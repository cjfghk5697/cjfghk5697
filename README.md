**CGI | Backend Engineer | Project Management | MLOps** <br>
At the Defense Integrated Data Center (DIDC), I ensured the security and integrity of the Department of Defense's data and systems as an IT security manager. Along with a team of IT professionals, I monitored, analyzed, and mitigated potential threats, and implemented and updated security policies and protocols. I also managed various IT projects, such as developing and testing new software and hardware solutions, and providing technical support and training to end-users. 

My passion is artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the fields of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and vision. I have demonstrated my skills and creativity in developing and applying AI solutions to image recognition and editing problems, winning several competitions. For instance, I received the Excellence Award at the Ajou University Deep Learning Challenge in 2021 for developing a high-accuracy image recognition AI based on given learning data. I also received the Creativity Award at the Army Start-up Competition in 2023 for creating an image editing AI and presenting a product demonstration video. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science at Ajou University, where I continue to learn and explore new AI techniques and applications.
