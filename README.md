**Diffusion | Backend Engineer | Project Management | Start-up** <br>
Adept in securing critical data and systems, I led a team of IT professionals to safeguard the Department of Defense’s digital assets. My role en‑
compassed threat mitigation, security policy implementation, and IT project management, with a keen focus on developing and testing advanced
software and hardware solutions. Fueled by a passion for artificial intelligence, particularly in CGI and vision, my innovative approach to AI applica‑
tions has been recognized with prestigious awards, including the Excellence Award at Ajou University Deep Learning Challenge and the Creativity
Award at the Army Start‑up Competition. As a Computer Science undergraduate at Ajou University, dedicated to mastering AI techniques and
exploring practical applications, preparing to contribute cutting‑edge solutions in technology‑driven environments.

• Hugging Face's Transformers and its community offer APIs and tools that facilitate easy downloading and training of state-of-the-art pretrained models. Translating the official documentation into Korean would contribute to the machine learning community, aiding those interested in the field. It would also enhance the Hugging Face community's resources.
